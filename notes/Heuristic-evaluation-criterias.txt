Show system status
- Time: Progress Indicator, Remaining Steps
- Space: Remaining Space
- Change: Change notification
- Action: e.g. Traffic Light
- Next steps: sth. has happened and what will happen next
- Completion: sth. is done

Familiar Metaphors and Language
- Use Common terms
- Use familiar Categories

User Control & Freedom
- Wizard for tasks you do once
- Freedom to undo
- Freedom to explore

Consistency
- Layout: e.g where are the buttons?
- Consistent Names: What terminology do users use?
-- e.g. Other with Exaple to discover new categories 
- Specific options in dialogs (e.g. not OK an cancel when not apropriate)

Error prevention
- Prevent Data Loss: e.g. a file already exists and may be overwritten
- Prevent Clutter: e.g. duplicate prevention with preview
- Prevent Confusing Flow: Label buttons appropriate
- Prevent Bad input: e.g. command line doesn't do, has a specific syntax to be used? (e.g. for date field)
- Unnecessary constraints: e.g. searching requires you to select a category first

Recognition over recall
- Avoid Codes: Where user must do a 'lookup'
- Avoid extra hurdles: e.g. use reasonable defaults instead of intermediary steps
- Previews: e.g. when selecting a template

Flexibility & efficiency
- Flexible Shortcuts (Accelerators - unseen by the novice user- speed up interaction for the expert)
- Flexible defaults with options: Popula options first/easy selectable
- Flexible Proactivity
- Recommendation
- Keep it relevant

Aesthetic & minimalist design
- Minimalism:
-- Core information above the fold
-- Signal-to-noise
-- e.g. no tables when having an option box
-- Redundancy
-- Functionality: e.g. no widgets for a site which will be used very infrequent

Recognize, diagnose & recover from errors
- Make Problem clear: when showing detected errors
- Provide a solution: e.g. "Not enough free Space" (OK)
- Propose an Alternative: e.g. when search doesn't find anything
- Recognize Errors: e.g. a severe security issue shoudl be displayed so (example Blocked pages in Firefox)

Help
- Learning with examples: e.g. on program language teaching sites
- Choices with examples
- Show the steps
- Help point things out: Combine help within the User interface
- Help clearly: e.g. summaries of long information (like EULA)
- Help people have fun: Example: Joke in the inside of a combo box
