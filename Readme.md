# My Next Days
A webapp prototype for coursera.org HCI course. 

## What does it let people do
The webapp “My Next Days” should satisfy the need to manage the upcoming events, deadlines or notes with a single input field, where both information "when" and "what" can be provided, as known form a post-it-note.

## Technology
HTML, CSS, Javascript and the power jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap (played with it for the first time and I like it).

## Demo
