# My Next Days
A webapp prototype for coursera.org HCI course. The course took place in October and November 2012.

## What does it let people do
The webapp “My Next Days” should satisfy the need to manage the upcoming events, deadlines or notes with a single input field, where both information "when" and "what" can be provided, as known from a post-it-note.

## Technology
HTML, CSS, Javascript and the power jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap (played with it for the first time and I like it).

## Evolution
The My Next Days protoytpe evolved with the assignments from the HCI Course:

1. NeedFinding
2. Prototyping
3. Start Building
4. Ready for Testing
5. User Testing

### Prototypes
You may have a look at the low fidelity prototypes (made with [Pencil](http://pencil.evolus.vn/) Software).
